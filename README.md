# Infinite_Impulse_Respone-Pole_Zero_Filter
One of IIR signal processing method using Pole Zero

The method used in this program is the Infinite Impulse Response Pole-Zero Filter Method, where the characteristics of the Pole Zero determine the shape of the Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, and Band Stop filters.
From the Pole and Zero placement, we can get data to plot the response magnitude, phase response, and also the filter output.
Noise is given and the effect of the filter on the noise of each type has been seen.

In its depiction, pole zero is composed of the values of r (radius) and theta (angle), which is the position to determine the pole value from the point 0.0.
Radius affects the results of the resulting output signal, that is, the greater the value of r accompanied by changes in the value of theta will produce a better signal output. 
Teta also plays a role in determining the cut off value.
The cut off value is the value at which the signal starts to be filtered according to the type of filter used.
The greater the theta value, the greater the cut-off frequency value.
